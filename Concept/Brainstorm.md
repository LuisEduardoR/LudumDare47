# Brainstorm

## Theme:

Stuck in a loop

## Idea:

Players control a car stuck in a roller coaster loop

- They can control where the car goes but are stuck to the loop's tracks
- They must defend agains enemies that will attack them
- They have weapons on the roller coaster cars that always fire up relative to the position they are in the loop 
- They must move inside the loop to avoid enemies/projectiles and line up shots
- They have access to a store between rounds
- They can buy extra cars and fit them with weapons in the store
- They can upgrade/downgrade the weapon of any car in the store (paying or receiving the difference in cost)
- Cars have a health bar and need to repaired at the store (the players pay for the repairs)
- If the first car is destroyed the player loses
- If a car in the middle is destroyed all cars behind it are also destroyed
- Having a larger number of cars allows more fire power but increases the chances one of them will be hit and increase the risk of losing more cars if one in the middle is destroyed
